Getting by taking

some deep breaths

call to my body protectors King black Cobra and Old World Man

to stand guard over my body

in this space this room only allowing it energies as great itself or greater

call on merge with my dream team stack Tez Mani

my Angel of neutrality in light of discernment

Teni

asked you to open the blessing fields

and regulate the energies for a powerful clear

journey a healing

call to Chinata

a call to King Marvin

we lift out of this body or call to ascend it

to merge

together we lift out of this body

to journey

to receive further information and clarity

on what was revealed in the levels of the continuum

of finding the seagull bones on the beach

transitioning to

the second level

feeding the bones to King Marvin

to grow legs

and I asked for clarity

along that path for what I need for this next step

of creating message and communication

will go on to the landing page the content and copy

will track the people

will entice them to the dancing snake

will make the snake dance

show me the balance

to remain true to the purpose the vision and mission

really embracing

with empathy and compassion

what the people

need to hear

to be drawn to

the dancing snake.

So lifting out of this body,

I asked my training team

to guide me.

I see the opening to the lower world so we'll go there

entering the portal 10 987654321

and merge into the low world landscape of purple and orange

once again see this base docking

I feel confusion

radicalness and thoughts

stay I asked you to

do settlement

call to the angel of neutrality

light up discernment and clear

where we are journeying to

spirit donkey joins along for the ride

we had towards the mountain

through the rain

in the lightning

lies between us in the mountains

this lightning

perceiving it as a barrier

How will we get through to the mountains

ended up jumping mouse's

dashing across the prairie

this lightning

this collective

nuff anchors the word

combustible

this rapid flare up of energy

a call to my team

do we need to go through the lightning this is something we need to do to transform it

it's blocking us

we seek a way around

it

it needs to be transformed to purple

Ascendant is showing

a tunnel

clear path

opening in a lightning

contrary and my first impression the lightning is not the people

is keeping other people flow behind me.

I'm leading them through this internal

scatter Moses field got to say

call upon the help of my spirits

to create this tunnel

through the lightning

take this leadership role

talk about

this path that will take them beyond this thing that has held them back

In

this tunnel

can help us all

to move through this dangerous chaos

so the next question is that the next part is

to see the tunnel

standing at the tunnel entrance

delivering

a speech

that people are curious but hesitant

I need to tell them I'm here to lead you

through the tunnel

in the lightning storm

to the other side so that we may reach the sacred mountains

okay this kind of a progression

go into the prairie of everyday life

impassable storm lightning

create

the magic

opens the tunnel

and then right now we're really focusing on the stage of

talking to the people

it's important to first let them know

we are guiding them through the tunnel we will go first we will lead them

again you gotta before that even tie them

set this up that they're blocked from the sacred mountain by this lightning and they've been waiting to get through it.

And we are here now with this tunnel we have created

and we will be the guides we will lead them to the other side

and allow them to move on the path to the sacred mountains to continue to approach and reach the sacred mountains

let's zoom in there's the leading not alone

and then saying yes, it is scary.

And this is reminding me of

getting the negatives out there getting those objections the accusation audits

because the accusation audits

of why they should

try to go through this impossible storm

the tunnel looks too good to be true

it's a little bit of angry murmuring.

Back at them forward is not enough goal of

spirituality so

spirit how do we get them to follow me

I

find a way for them

to connect with me

as a trusted spiritual adviser through technology

maybe I was wrong about leading them through

as a kid keeps seeing the journey we stand beside maybe

I introduce spirit wave

and part of their fear stems from

the actual moving through the tunnel

you're surrounded by the lightning storm

transparency of the tunnel

how might we

change the shape of the tunnel spirit

center

the carnival

the shops and wonders

carnival the festival

this is going to be

an enjoyable fun path lots to explore

see

entertainment of the engagement

some may see it as hucksters.

Change the

exchange

needs to give money right

see the snake dancing is this sense of

wonder

just drawing people in

balloons and children laughing

each of these booths restaurants

These are what we will build

in the towel

so, I need to paint the broader picture of

this pathway of white wonders

spirit wave

might even be

not even in the tunnel yet, but

try them and baby ready to live

The

first step the first carbon you see maybe there's some more midday you have more of

like the swag is like invaded opaque transparent interchange transparency

and this dancing snake that's a bigger metaphor maybe for this whole process the dancy thing

is just the first like coming crystallizing and becoming fully opaque right coming into itself

these don't necessarily match one to one with the snake right

that's like people going by and being drawn to the tunnel

try to compartmentalize it

step right up

carnival barker

Willy Wonka

the ringmaster

this is the way that I am the snake charmer

I'm asking about the bones

those important now

this is your marketing copy. This isn't the bath right

repeat that again like that.

The accusation audit of acknowledging that people feel blocked and without purpose and spiritual vision.

Meaning the sacred balance

I almost like language like

we all have this vision of a greater humanity. But we're blocked by this

storm of issues of

more disrespect to vision

in this chaotic storm

but I've created a tunnel

in the sense that it's a circus then it's not threatening. It's a place of entertainment. Go wax museum or freaks and oddities but

not grotesque.

Or whatever it is that that draws people in

then start again with the accusation audit of you've got their attention about this tunnel. Why they would be afraid to go through the tunnel

even the tunnel looks scary right and then

the Karneval the festival

It's not a transparent town it's a festival.

Store storm as above us held back and a high ceiling

are induced to a light source

through an opaque

transparent plain

that evens it out.

Maybe in places you can't see and steal.

But it's taking the focus it's there.

But they're looking to the sides looking to the path they're moving through the tongue.

Acknowledging the good of AI

comfort and distraction

appealing to that, or maybe not those things but those negative emotions holding them back

striking them in, they're going to interact with the spirit wave.

And there'll be other things on their path

that this can be an exciting journey of wonders

through this process they'll come out

will come out

with a clear path,

the sacred mountains to the visions that they hold for humanity

right, they're all going through this everyday life, we're looking for that and

maybe they need an encouragement of courage and courage, right

we need to focus on the follower, the first follower

they had the courage and they're going to start the stream and more and more people flow through this tunnel to the sacred balance

oh there there is no way around.

Back in the early part of it there's

going through it is also like we're going to face it we're not going to run away from it we're going to leverage

the scary thing called AI which is all bound to this general like mistrust and fear

that everybody has in a bigger sense

there's not going to be over we're not going to avoid AI we're not going to avoid these things unless we figure out a way to get through it

right we don't have blocked by

achieving our vision the vision here is

greater humaneness greater humankind

and really appealing that each person has a mission or many people have this vision of how they can see a better humanity

spirit is there anything else I need to know about this particular visual metaphor for the copying content

looking at the audience right there was the

the anger

to trust as part of the Carnival

let's call him angry man

let's look at the people who are going to be the first followers the people

because what CR said is true here right there's going to be people who may be very woowoo

but they're definitely afraid in the wall

The angry man is simply angry

only to melt his heart to

think that's going to be the first follower

I'm not really

understanding that. Angry Man is the first farmer

who had to melt his heart

The first step is to get him to hear.

Made a story about connecting to childhood

Oh yes childhood and

remember in the sense of Carnival this whole thing is as a connection point to Hey Do we all remember how

the world was

before you know it could just be not to say like kids or a bygone time but

tap into that sense of nostalgia and tie in to moving forward tie it to melting the heart like that will be the melting in that

this tunnel was actually you know, like that this is enjoyable

return to a place where there was wonder and imagination

turned to a place where

we came together and laughs

helped each other out.

People were benevolent and we could trust them

right it's like this is we all know that has gone and now there's this big lightning storm but

we want that back and AI

is the engagement point but

it's it's putting the people back Oh, you're gonna go do all these things here. And it's fun and wonderous. And you get to engage with it

and you're getting back what you're looking for like It's like that thing that you miss Thank you have that word establishing for is actually

some new interpretation that we're going to take humanity in the direction as you see it an AI as a way to reflect that begin to reflect

the speech and the qualities that will help us to grow and help move us

through this into

the patient into the new place

that'll get angry man

you know acknowledge that frustration and anger that people have

that bring up this nostalgia bring up this

good memories we all have or that people have can say everyone has been memories

that sense of anger and mistress like the mob mentality at the front so that's going to anger me he's like the the loudest one right so that's why I'm focused the message on him

that message works across

mistrusts of hurts

it's all these healings

but accusation audit that that anger

that rage that how upset

and pissed off people are

about how things are

use that

you know, we're stuck. We're stuck. Yeah, we're angry because it's holding us back we can get to where we want and the sacred mountains

and again, that can be very individualized. It doesn't have to be specific. Let let each person paint their own

visions for humanity, you know their traditions, because they all have a piece right to play in that.

In

All

right and people are going to split off they're going to be the left side here the

people who are just not ready to face technology and AI

now on the side the opposite end of that is this

you know anger and maybe a mistake I guess some of those people where's the mistrust of

the spirit of it it can be

could be some people are gonna branch off because it's too demonic then

that's kind of a key spirit how do we get

there's Wunderman in the cons from the magic of it being

spiritually abused

maybe use more

common with that what do you think Spirit

sent and be

actually a clown but I have this thing about clowns

it tells you in a different way besides a clown

yeah I don't want to get into

I remember that Willy Wonka

he's like that Disney Experience

World Magic

or you're luring them in even we say these things to get by at this is this world and magic work

we can engage with this

we've all talked about it like empathy but we don't want it to feel political.

We like to feel like Disneyland it's so funny that that was

saying I was trying like the outcome

oh god Magic Kingdom here right magic tunnel

it's in that way like connect with the feeling

like this is transcendent It's surreal

escape

it's a reward

and it's it's safe right it's curate you're not gonna fall out the roller coaster

you're not gonna you're not in danger. Right create that safety you're not in danger

so maybe if carnival does if that works for me, like the feeling of Disneyland or some

suspend disbelief environment, you know where you realize this this production

that's a little bit of safety from

some of the more metaphysical concepts

like that's what I want I write that that edge

like when you're at the vision question, the thing happens that you're like, wow.

Like it's an experience

that touches you

That's close

in a way that

you know you can try to explain it away but you do have that experience right where

they're gonna connect with that

bit

and then the tunnel

food shops like metaphorical food the the attractions things like the spirit way

other engagements

parts

maybe these are all my productions goes to the machines productions

and later there'll be a message

maybe that's like the main attraction of this this exit portal

maybe I'm stretching the metaphor too too far

Hey, that's just as efficient here that some time and we don't address that problem right now people getting stuck in the tunnel and not leaving the tunnel

save that for another day

now it's time to get people in the tunnel

seems really consistent with making the Snake Dance

right that was this whole image of luring them in and this dangerous pass this thing past this dangerous thing or afraid of the Cobra

because it's dancing and transmitting and it's this beautiful crystal snake we we live through the fear Oh moving through the fear right

all right.

Feeling complete

Oh, yes wizard.

Stone as a wizard not only for Moses necessarily. Row but I had the little hat on the staff. Snake

to have a wine beer.

Ben, Ben Ben. Ben

Ben

Barker yeah, there's different Well, I think I have all that missed.

Step right. Right. It's not

like it has that like we're gonna read through this. We're escaping like had that initial Moses thing.

Or maybe Moses did have to entice people

nothing chasing us.

It's a barrier in front of us. Right? So maybe that's the difference of Moses Parting the Waters.

They had no choice of their being pursued and it was an escape

they're both paths forward.

The sea was a barrier but the sea

there are some similarities in terms of fire land,

and stuff that danger of being pursued. We don't want to hurt people and we're going to carnival bark. And they're going to want to come through right there.

gotta make a choice they can they can keep wandering this part of the prairie never

never facing

in the storm is going to move closer and closer to them

but

lapel flower on the barber

shoes like

that's what I was trying to do with the Willy Wonka thing How do I fuse

fuse the wizard and the

ringmaster?

Losing my focus

right don't think it's been some let's just create it

right don't hurt and create it and it'll develop itself

alright, I didn't feel complete losing focus

this is what I need to get done today.

Working towards today

I'll do the bones, the single attorney

and different time

so I begin to head back

to the portal

back up to the Middle World stepping into it 123456789

And then I was back in this room come fully into the body

and into ordinary reality
